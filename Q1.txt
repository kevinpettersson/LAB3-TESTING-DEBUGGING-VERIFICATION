Error: a postcondition could not be proved on this return path
Could not prove: a > b

Dafny reports this beacuse our post-condition ensures that a > b, 
but the method only checks when x > y and then assigns a, b their according values.
If x == y then the else branch would also be false since it would break the post-condition.




(program statement)
S = if x > y then x := a, y := b else x := b, y := a

(post-condition)
R = a > b

(weakest pre-condition)

wp(S, R) =
