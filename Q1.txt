Error: a postcondition could not be proved on this return path
Could not prove: a > b

Dafny reports this beacuse our post-condition ensures that a > b, 
but the method only checks when x > y and then assigns a, b their according values.
If x == y then the else branch would also be false since it would break the post-condition.
Dafny requires that we restrict the possible inputs by creating a pre-condition where we require: x != y.

S needs to start in a state x > y or x < y
S cannot start in a state x == y then the post-condition wont be satisfied.
Therefore Q needs to be x > y or x < y


(program statement)
S :
    if (x > y) 
    then a := x, b := y 
    else a := y, b := x

(post-condition)
R :
    a > b

(pre-condition)
Q = x != y (klart det ska vara så men är det rätt ändå?)

(weakest pre-condition)
wp(S, R) :
    wp(if (x > y) then (a := x, b := y) else (a := y, b := x), a > b) =
    (By Conditional Rule)
    (x > y) -> wp((a := x, b := y), a > b) && not(x > y) -> wp((a := y, b := x), a > b) =
    (By Assignment Rule)
    (x > y) -> (x > y) && not(x > y) -> (y > x)
